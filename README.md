# pinyin

**A pure JavaScript lib to convert hanzi (Chinese) to pinyin with Intl API.**

The lib takes advantage of `Intl.Collator` API, and can convert hanzi to pinyin with less than 500 lines (include built-in small dict)! And the lib can be used with all browsers who support `Intl.Collator` API and support locale languages.
